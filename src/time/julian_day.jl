# ============================================================================
#
# The Julian Day Count is a uniform count of days from a remote epoch in the
# past (-4712 January 1, 12 hours Greenwich Mean Time (Julian proleptic
# Calendar) = 4713 BCE January 1, 12 hours GMT (Julian proleptic Calendar) =
# 4714 BCE November 24, 12 hours GMT (Gregorian proleptic Calendar)). At this
# instant, the Julian Day Number is 0. It is convenient for astronomers to use
# since it is not necessary to worry about odd numbers of days in a month,
# leap years, etc. Once you have the Julian Day Number of a particular date
# in history, it is easy to calculate time elapsed between it and any other
# Julian Day Number.
#
# The Julian Day Count has nothing to do with the Julian Calendar introduced by
# Julius Caesar. It is named for Julius Scaliger, the father of Josephus Justus
# Scaliger, who invented the concept. It can also be thought of as a logical
# follow-on to the old Egyptian civil calendar, which also used years of
# constant lengths.
#
# Scaliger chose the particular date in the remote past because it was before
# recorded history and because in that year, three important cycles coincided
# with their first year of the cycle: The 19-year Metonic Cycle, the 15-year
# Indiction Cycle (a Roman Taxation Cycle) and the 28-year Solar Cycle (the
# length of time for the old Julian Calendar to repeat exactly).

"""
    jd_to_date([T,] JD::Number)

Convert a date represented in Julian Day `JD` to Gregorian Calendar. The
optional parameter `T` defines the return type. If `T` is omitted, then it
defaults to `Int`.

# Returns

If `T` is omitted or `Int`, then a tuple with the following data will be
returned:

* Year.
* Month (`1` => **January**, `2` => **February**, ...).
* Day.
* Hour (0 - 24).
* Minute (0 - 59).
* Second (0 - 59).

Notice that if `T` is `Int`, then the seconds field will be Integer. Otherwise,
it will be floating point.

If `T` is `Date`, then it will return the Julia structure `Date`. Notice that
the hours, minutes, and seconds will be neglected because the structure `Date`
does not handle them.

If `T` is `DateTime`, then it will return the Julia structure `DateTime`.

# Remarks

The algorithm was obtained from \\[2] (Accessed on 2018-04-11). In [2], there is
the following warning:

> Note: This method will not give dates accurately on the Gregorian Proleptic
> Calendar, i.e., the calendar you get by extending the Gregorian calendar
> backwards to years earlier than 1582. using the Gregorian leap year rules.
> In particular, the method fails if Y<400.
