    eclipse_time_summary(JD₀::Number, a::Number, e::Number, i::Number, RAAN::Number, w::Number, Δd::Integer, relative::Bool = false, Δt₀::AbstractFloat = -1.0)

Compute the eclipse time of an orbit with semi-major axis `a` [m], eccentricity
`e`, inclination `i` [rad], initial right ascension of the ascending node `RAAN`
[rad], and initial argument of perigee `w` [rad]. The orbit epoch, which is also
the day in which the analysis will begin, is `JD₀` [Julian Day]. The analysis
will be performed for each day during `Δd` days.

This function will compute the eclipse time of one orbit per day.

If the argument `relative` is `true`, then the computed times will be relative
to the nodal period [%]. Otherwise, they will be computed in seconds. By
default, `relative = false`.

The argument `Δt₀` can be used to select the time step in which the orbit will
be propagated. Notice that this algorithm performs a numerical search to find
the beginning of each section (sunlight, penumbra, and umbra) with millisecond
precision. Thus, selecting a high number for `Δt₀` will make the analysis
faster, but the accuracy is lost if a region time span is smalled than `Δt₀`. If
this parameter is omitted or if it is negative, then the time step will be
selected automatically to match a mean anomaly step of 5°.

All the analysis is performed using a J2 orbit propagator.
